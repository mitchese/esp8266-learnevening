# Why ESP8266

* Good, Cheap, Easy. Choose ~~2~~ 3
* Huge & Vibrant Community
* Many modules
  * Wemos, NodeMCU, bare module, among others
* Integrated in some finished products (Sonoff,etc)

---

# How to use

* Programmers vs built-in
* Arduino "IDE" or Atom.io
* Wiring Diagram

---

# Modules

# Getting our hands dirty


In your bag, you will find one Wemos D1 Mini. Plug it into your computer and let's make something work!

Follow the instructions for blink.

---

# Using WiFi

Follow the instructions for the Base code or skip to the rgb led code

This will work either on your Wemos D1 - or if you were to flash it to my MagicHome controller, it would work immediately

# Hooking to HomeAssistant

MQTT we can integrate our light into HomeAssistant

* Allow complex control and automation
* Act / React to all kinds of events
  * HomeAssistant connected to Kodi (XBMC); when TV on, then dim lights
  * Scrape times from Deutsche Bahn & show status of my next train
  * When doorbell rings, notify HomeAssistant; if I'm home, pause TV; otherwise push notification
  * Log temperature / humidity to Prometheus / Grafana

---

# HASS setup

HomeAssistant is running hass.io on the raspberry pi here; Connect your MQTT and we can play around with it
